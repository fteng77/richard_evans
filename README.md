**Dr. Evans** came to UChicago in the fall of 2016 as a Senior Lecturer for the Masters of Computational Social Science Program, the Director of the Open Source Macroeconomics Laboratory, and a Fellow for the Becker Friedman Institute. Dr. Evans specializes in macroeconomics, public economics, computational economics, and international macroeconomics. Rick was the Co-Founder and Co-Director of the BYU Macroeconomics and Computational Laboratory and one of the original nine members of the Utah Economic Council. Rick is also a former member of the Board of Directors of the Economic Club of Utah, a chapter of the National Association of Business Economics. Aside from his educational experience, Rick began his economic career as a Research Economist at Thredgold Economic Associates in Salt Lake City, providing state and national economic analysis for Zions Bank and their operations in eight western states. He has also spent time as a researcher at the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and as an economic consultant. Rick has most recently partnered with the Open Source Policy Center at the American Enterprise Institute in building its large-scale macroeconomic model for dynamic scoring and integrating it with the microsimulation static scoring model.
